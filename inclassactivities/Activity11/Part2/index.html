            <h3>Book description</h3>
            <div id="tabs-1">
                <p>With this book, you can teach yourself how to design web pages the way the
                professionals do, by using HTML and CSS in tandem to structure and format the
                page content. It begins with a crash course that teaches you more about HTML
                and CSS than you can learn from most full books. That includes a chapter on
                Responsive Web Design that shows you how to build responsive websites that will
                look and work right on all devices, from phones to tablets to desktop computers.</p>
                <p>After that, this book shows you how to enhance your web pages with features
                like images, forms with built-in data validation, and audio and video clips.
                You'll also learn how to use JavaScript and jQuery to add features like image
                rollovers, image swaps, and slide shows. You'll learn how to use jQuery UI and
                jQuery plugins to add features like accordions, tabs, carousels, and slide shows.
                And you'll learn how to use jQuery Mobile to develop separate websites for mobile
                devices.</p>
