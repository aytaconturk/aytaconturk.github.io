                            <p>Turks carried out the first ever anti-aircraft operation in history during the
                                Italo-Turkish war. Although lacking anti-aircraft weapons, they were the first to shoot
                                down an aeroplane by rifle fire. The first aircraft to crash in a war was the one of
                                Lieutenant Piero Manzini, shot down on August 25, 1912.</p>

                            <p>The earliest known use of weapons specifically made for the anti-aircraft role occurred
                                during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. After the disaster at Sedan, Paris was besieged
                                and French troops outside the city started an attempt at communication via balloon.
                                Gustav Krupp mounted a modified 1-pounder (37mm) gun – the Ballonabwehrkanone (Balloon
                                defence cannon) or BaK — on top of a horse-drawn carriage for the purpose of shooting
                                down these balloons.</p>

                            <p>By 1913 only France and Germany had developed field guns suitable for engaging balloons
                                and aircraft and addressed issues of military organisation. Britain's Royal Navy would
                                soon introduce the QF 3-inch and QF 4-inch AA guns and also had Vickers 1-pounder quick
                                firing "pom-pom"s that could be used in various mountings.</p>

                            <h4 class="news-h4">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</h4>

                            <p class="mt-0">The first US anti-aircraft cannon was a 1-pounder concept design by Admiral
                                Twining in 1911 to meet the perceived threat of airships, that eventually was used as
                                the basis for the US Navy's first operational anti-aircraft cannon: the 3"/23 caliber
                                gun.</p>

                            <p>AA gunnery was a difficult business. The problem was of successfully aiming a shell to
                                burst close to its target's future position, with various factors affecting the shells'
                                predicted trajectory. This was called deflection gun-laying, 'off-set' angles for range
                                and elevation were set on the gunsight and updated as their target moved. In this method
                                when the sights were on the target, the barrel was pointed at the target's future
                                position. Range and height of the target determined fuse length. The difficulties
                                increased as aircraft performance improved.</p>

                            <p>However, the problem of deflection settings — 'aim-off' — required knowing the rate of
                                change in the target's position. Both France and UK introduced tachymetric devices to
                                track targets and produce vertical and horizontal deflection angles. The French Brocq
                                system was electrical, the operator entered the target range and had displays at guns;
                                it was used with their 75 mm. The British Wilson-Dalby gun director used a pair of
                                trackers and mechanical tachymetry; the operator entered the fuse length, and deflection
                                angles were read from the instruments.</p>

                            <p>By the start of World War I, the 77 mm had become the standard German weapon, and came
                                mounted on a large traverse that could be easily picked up on a wagon for movement.
                                Krupp 75 mm guns were supplied with an optical sighting system that improved their
                                capabilities. The German Army also adapted a revolving cannon that came to be known to
                                Allied fliers as the "flaming onion" from the shells in flight. This gun had five
                                barrels that quickly launched a series of 37 mm artillery shells.</p>

                            <h4 class="news-h4">Dolorem est, sapiente! Iste nulla odio quibusdam.</h4>
                            <p class="mt-0">Four years of war had seen the creation of a new and technically demanding
                                branch of military activity. Air defence had made huge advances, albeit from a very low
                                starting point. However, it was new and often lacked influential 'friends' in the
                                competition for a share of limited defence budgets. Demobilisation meant that most AA
                                guns were taken out of service, leaving only the most modern.</p>

                            <p>However, there were lessons to be learned. In particular the British, who had had AA guns
                                in most theatres in action in daylight and used them against night attacks at home.
                                Furthermore, they had also formed an Anti-Aircraft Experimental Section during the war
                                and accumulated large amounts of data that was subjected to extensive analysis. As a
                                result, they published, in 1924–1925, the two-volume Textbook of Anti-Aircraft Gunnery.
                                It included five key recommendations for HAA equipment:</p>

                            <p>The US ended World War I with two 3-inch AA guns and improvements were developed
                                throughout the inter-war period. However, in 1924 work started on a new 105 mm static
                                mounting AA gun, but only a few were produced by the mid-1930s because by this time work
                                had started on the 90 mm AA gun, with mobile carriages and static mountings able to
                                engage air, sea and ground targets. The M1 version was approved in 1940. During the
                                1920s there was some work on a 4.7-inch which lapsed, but revived in 1937, leading to a
                                new gun in 1944.</p>

                            <p>While HAA and its associated target acquisition and fire control was the primary focus of
                                AA efforts, low-level close-range targets remained and by the mid-1930s were becoming an
                                issue.</p>

                            <p>The 40 mm Bofors had become available in 1931. In the late 1920s the Swedish Navy had
                                ordered the development of a 40 mm naval anti-aircraft gun from the Bofors company. It
                                was light, rapid-firing and reliable, and a mobile version on a four-wheel carriage was
                                soon developed. Known simply as the 40 mm, it was adopted by some 17 different nations
                                just before World War II and is still in use today in some applications such as on
                                coastguard frigates.</p>

                            <h4 class="news-h4">Error eum nemo odit sint voluptates?</h4>
                            <p class="mt-0">The Soviet Union also used a 37 mm, the 37 mm M1939, which appears to have
                                been copied from the Bofors 40 mm. A Bofors 25 mm, essentially a scaled down 40 mm, was
                                also copied as the 25 mm M1939.</p>

                            <p>During the 1930s solid-fuel rockets were under development in the Soviet Union and
                                Britain. In Britain the interest was for anti-aircraft fire, it quickly became clear
                                that guidance would be required for precision. However, rockets, or 'unrotated
                                projectiles' as they were called, could be used for anti-aircraft barrages. A 2-inch
                                rocket using HE or wire obstacle warheads was introduced first to deal with low-level or
                                dive bombing attacks on smaller targets such as airfields. The 3-inch was in development
                                at the end of the inter-war period.</p>

                            <p>While the 3.7-inch was the main HAA gun in fixed defences and the only mobile HAA gun
                                with the field army, the QF 4.5-inch gun, manned by artillery, was used in the vicinity
                                of naval ports and made use of the naval ammunition supply. The 4.5-inch at Singapore
                                had the first success in shooting down Japanese bombers. Mid war QF 5.25-inch naval guns
                                started being emplaced in some permanent sites around London. This gun was also deployed
                                in dual-role coast defence/AA positions.</p>
